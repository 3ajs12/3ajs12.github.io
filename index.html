    <h1 style="font-family:Lucida Console;">"The Adventures of a Wanderlust Heart"</h1>
    <DIV class='img'><img src="Pic for web project.jpg" alt="ocean pic" height='300' width='430'>		<p>Why travel the world? Do you not have anything better to do with your time? 
		These questions have begun to resinate in my mind as I finish my last year of college. 
		See having a heart that longs for adventure is not a curse, not in the least; it is the greatest blessing that one can recieve.
		I have become addicted to the feeling I get when I set foot in a new location for the first time. 
		Everything is so new and exciting; who has walked here before me and what was there story?</p> 
	<p>		The summer of 2016 my family and I took a trip to Maui. Eventhough I had seen different parts of the world, including Europe
		I had never taken the time to fully appreciate what was in front of me. I made it my goal that I would find atleast two 
		locations that took my breath away. As I soon found them, I realized there was so much more in store for me. I remember sitting on this rock that 
		protruded out into the ocean with waves crashing all around it. Sitting there I closed my eyes and let my mind take over, the result was
		truly extraordinary. The most powerful force on earth was swirling around me and yet I sat in perfect protection from it's fury.
		</p>
	<p>		The second place that I found was located at the location where we were staying. There was a wall that was built in order to protect the adjoining condo building from
		getting washed away when the tide would come in late in the day. I decided to climb up to the outmost point that overlooked the reef below and saw nothing but magnificant beauty
		out from me. If the tide was out you could see marine life swimming by and if you were really lucky you would see a sea turtle feeding on the algae. If you haven't figured it 
		out yet, heights bring a sense of peace to me. When you remove yourself from the world that you walk through everyday, you begin to gain a new perspective on life. Once you take
		that new perspective and apply it to every aspect of your life, you will see everything in a new way.</p>
	<p>		When you get a taste of adventure and how beautiful the world is outside of the little bubble that we all live in, your eyes open and
		your sense of needing to get away becomes more evident than ever. Since getting back, I have searched for new adventures and places to get 
		away from the stress and hectic life of college. I yearn to pick up and leave for a place I have never been before. Finding peace and 
		rejuvenation helps the heart heal and the mind wander to unknown places. If fear is holding you back, take a deep breath and jump head first into the next 
		adventure that presents itself to you. Even if you do not fall in love with the sense of adventure, you will gain knowledge that will help mold you into the 
		person that you will be one day.</p>
	<p> GO! What do you have to lose?</p></DIV>
